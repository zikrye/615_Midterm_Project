This midterm project involves combining agricultural information from the USDA on strawberries and on chemical (pesticide, insecticide, fungicide, etc) usage. We chose to explore the amount of strawberries produced per acre per application of chemical. We looked at this variable across time, between states, and both.  

To work on the midterm project, we have created the following files in this repository.

1. The "data_and_eda.R" file contains all of our data cleaning and EDA. It is sourced in our "Midterm Presentation.Rmd" and "MidtermPDF.Rmd" file, which outputs an IoSlide presentation and PDF file respectively. 
2. The "shiny.Rmd" file is a shiny app that produces a plot on chemical by state. You are able to zoom in and see the summary information. It also produces a map, where you can select the year to see production by state.  
3. "Midterm Presentation.Rmd" produces the "Midterm-Presentation.html", which we used to make a presentation in the calss.
4. "MidtermPDF.Rmd" file produces "MidtermPDF.pdf", which describes our way of EDA, its results and conclusions.
5. Other files including datasets support the code to run.
