This midterm project involves combining agricultural information from the USDA on strawberries and on chemical (pesticide, insecticide, fungicide, etc) usage. The "data_and_eda.R" file contains all of our data cleaning and EDA. It is sourced in our "Midterm Presentation.Rmd" file, which outputs an IoSlide presentation. We chose to explore the amount of strawberries produced per acre per application of chemical. We looked at this variable across time, between states, and both.  
The "shiny.Rmd" file is a shiny app that produces a plot on chemical by state. You are able to zoom in and see the summary information. It also produces a map, where you can select the year to see production by state.
